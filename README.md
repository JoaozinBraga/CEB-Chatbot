Eu queria agradecer a este pessoal:

- Fungus: His Tastybot has been a source of inspiration for most of the features, and his help with coding problems has been invaluable to make this bot.
- TAT, Origin and other Litebot contributors: Their Litebot has inspired features like Roulette.
- Henchman: Never knew this undertaking would give me a friend too.
